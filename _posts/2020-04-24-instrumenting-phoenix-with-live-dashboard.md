The recent release of the [LiveDashboard](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_dashboard) library allows us to visualize our application metrics, performance and behavior in real-time. In this post, we'll add LiveDashboard to our Phoenix app, examine the out-of-the-box features and take a look under the hood to understand how LiveDashboard hooks into Telemetry events in order to visualize them.

## The App

We'll be working with the Phoenix app we set up for our Telemetry series of blog posts, [Quantum](https://github.com/elixirschool/telemetry-code-along/tree/live-dashboard). The Quantum app doesn't do much--it really just exists to be measured. In this post, we'll set up a Telemetry supervisor that implements a set of metrics definitions for Telemetry events. The metrics we'll define match up to some out-of-the-box Telemetry events emitted by Phoenix and Ecto. For a deeper dive on Telemetry events, check out our series of posts on [Instrumenting Phoenix with Telemetry](https://elixirschool.com/blog/instrumenting-phoenix-with-telemetry-part-one/). Upcoming posts in this series take a closer look at the out-of-the-box Telemetry events offered by Phoenix and Ecto, walkthrough how to add our own Telemetry events and more.

### The Code

The final code for this walkthrough can be found [here](https://github.com/elixirschool/telemetry-code-along/tree/live-dashboard).

## Adding LiveDashboard

First, we'll add the LiveDashboard dependency to our Phoenix app:

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:phoenix_live_dashboard, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Next up, we'll ensure LiveView is configured:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :quantum, QuantumWeb.Endpoint,
  live_view: [signing_salt: "SECRET_SALT"]
```

Then, we'll ensure the LiveView socket is declared in our app's `Endpoint`:

```elixir
# lib/quantum_web/endpoint.ex
socket "/live", Phoenix.LiveView.Socket
```

Lastly, we'll set up request forwarding from the `/dashboard` endpoint to the LiveDashboard in our router:

```elixir
use MyAppWeb, :router
import Phoenix.LiveDashboard.Router

...

if Mix.env() == :dev do
  scope "/" do
    pipe_through :browser
    live_dashboard "/dashboard"
  end
end
```

And that's it! If we run `mix deps.get` and then `mix phx.server`, we'll see our LiveDashboard with its out-of-the-box monitoring visualizations.

## LiveDashboard Out-Of-The-Box

### Home

![live dashboard home]({% asset ld-home.png @path %})

There are a number of monitoring features that LiveView displays for us out-of-the-box.

On the `Home` page, we can see system information like our Erlang/OTP version, Phoenix version and Elixir version. We also see some info about the number of ports, processes and atoms our app is responsible for.

### Processes

![live dashboard processes]({% asset ld-processes.png @path %})

The `Processes` page allows us to introspect on the processes running in our app. We can see helpful info like how much memory each process account for and even which function a given process is currently executing. Inspecting a given process, we see further info including its status, initial function and stacktrace.

### Ports

![live dashboard ports]({% asset ld-ports.png @path %})

The `Ports` page visualizes the ports (responsible for application I/O) exposed by our application.

Inspecting a given port, we can see the which process is responsible for exposing the port and managing input/output over that port.

![live dashboard port-detail]({% asset ld-port-detail.png @path %})

### Sockets

The `Sockets` page exposes information about all of the sockets currently managed by the application. Sockets in our Phoenix app are responsible for all UDP/TCP traffic. Here, we even see the socket connection responsible for listening on port `:4000`.

![live dashboard port-4000-detail]({% asset ld-port-4000-detail.png @path %})

### ETS

The last out-of-the-box page that the LiveDashboard offers us is the `ETS` page. ETS (Erlang Term Storage) is our in-memory storage. We can even se the entry for the Telemetry handler table.

![live dashboard ets-detail]({% asset ld-ets-detail.png @path %})

## LiveDashboard Metrics
### Establishing Metrics

There are two LiveDashboard features that we have to do a little bit of work to enable. We'll start with [LiveDashboard Metrics](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_dashboard/metrics.html#content), which leverages the `telemetry_metrics` library.

First, we'll add `telemetry_metrics` to our application's dependencies:

```elixir
# mix.exs
{:telemetry_metrics, "~> 0.4"},
```

And run `mix deps.get`

The [`Telemetry.Metrics`](https://hexdocs.pm/telemetry_metrics/Telemetry.Metrics.html) library provides an interface for casting Telemetry events as metrics. We'll take a closer look at this library in a later blog post, and just focus on a high-level understanding for now.

Now that we've installed the library, we're ready to define our Telemetry supervisor. The supervisor will implement a `metrics/0` function that declares the set of Telemetry events that we want to handle and specifies which metrics to construct for these events.

```elixir
# lib/quantum/telemetry.ex
defmodule Quantum.Telemetry do
  use Supervisor
  import Telemetry.Metrics

  def start_link(arg) do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, arg, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def init(_arg) do
    Supervisor.init([], strategy: :one_for_one)
  end

  def metrics do
    [
      # Erlang VM Metrics - Formats `gauge` metric type
      last_value("vm.memory.total", unit: :byte),
      last_value("vm.total_run_queue_lengths.total"),
      last_value("vm.total_run_queue_lengths.cpu"),
      last_value("vm.system_counts.process_count"),

      # Database Time Metrics - Formats `timing` metric type
      summary(
        "quantum.repo.query.total_time",
        unit: {:native, :millisecond},
        tags: [:source, :command]
      ),

      # Database Count Metrics - Formats `count` metric type
      counter(
        "quantum.repo.query.count",
        tags: [:source, :command]
      ),

      # Phoenix Time Metrics - Formats `timing` metric type
      summary(
        "phoenix.router_dispatch.stop.duration",
        unit: {:native, :millisecond}
      ),

      # Phoenix Count Metrics - Formats `count` metric type
      counter(
        "phoenix.router_dispatch.stop.count"
      ),

      counter(
        "phoenix.error_rendered.count"
      )
    ]
  end
end
```

Here, we're using the `Telemetry.Metrics`'s metrics functions (`counter`, `summary` and `last_value`) to specify which Telemetry events to treat as which kinds of metrics. Each of these functions takes in an argument of a Telemetry event, for example, `quantum.repo.query.total_time`. The events listed in our `metrics/0` function are all executed by Phoenix or Ecto source code for us, for free.

The `metrics/0` function is later passed to a LiveDashboard LiveView. LiveDashboard uses this list of Telemetry events-as-metrics to attach the appropriate handler for each event. For a refresher on how Telemetry events are executed and handled with the help of ETS, check out our intro to Telemetry blog post [here](https://elixirschool.com/blog/instrumenting-phoenix-with-telemetry-part-one/).

We'll revisit how this works in a bit. First, let's add our new supervisor to our app's supervision tree:

```elixir
# lib/quantum/application.ex

children = [
  Quantum.Repo,
  Quantum.Telemetry,
  Quantum.Endpoint,
  ...
]
```

Now we're ready to configure LiveDashboard with our newly defined metrics.

### Configuring LiveDashboard Metrics

We'll add the following option to our `live_dashboard` router call.

```elixir
# lib/quantum_web/router.ex
live_dashboard "/dashboard", metrics: Quantum.Telemetry
```

Now, if we visit `/dashboard` in the browser and click the `Metrics` tab we'll see our metrics:

![live dashboard metrics]({% asset ld-metrics.png @path %})

Let's take a peek under the hood to better understand how this configuration works.

### LiveDashboard Metrics Under the Hood

The `live_dashboard` macro contains the following line which routes live  `/metrics` requests to the `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.MetricsLive` LiveView, with a session payload containing the `metrics: Quantum.Telemetry` options we passed in:

```elixir
# live_dashboard/router.ex
live "/:node/metrics", Phoenix.LiveDashboard.MetricsLive, :metrics, opts
```

When the `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.MetricsLive` LiveView starts up, it calls on the `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.TelemetryListener.listen/2` function with an argument of the metrics we defined in `Quantum.Telemetry`.

The `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.TelemetryListener` module is responsible for attaching a set of handlers to Telemetry events by storing the event/handler combos in ETS. The `init/1` function of the `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.TelemetryListener` iterates over the metrics we defined in `Quantum.Telemetry`, and stores each metric's Telemetry event name in ETS with a handler of its own `handle_metrics/4` function.

```elixir
# live_dashboard/telemetry_listener.ex
def init({parent, metrics}) do
  metrics = Enum.with_index(metrics, 0)
  metrics_per_event = Enum.group_by(metrics, fn {metric, _} -> metric.event_name end)

  for {event_name, metrics} <- metrics_per_event do
    id = {__MODULE__, event_name, self()}
    :telemetry.attach(id, event_name, &handle_metrics/4, {parent, metrics})
  end

  {:ok, %{ref: ref, events: Map.keys(metrics_per_event)}}
end
```

Recall from our earlier post on Telemetry that the `:telemetry.attach/4` function stores entries in ETS that map the Telemetry event to the handler. Later, when the given Telemetry event is executed (for example, when Ecto source code executes the `"quantum.repo.query.total_time"` event), Telemetry will look up the event with this name in ETS and call the stored handler function, in this case `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.TelemetryListener.handle_metrics/4`

Taking a look at the `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.TelemetryListener.handle_metrics/4` function, we can see that it does some work to format the metric for the event and then sends a message to its `parent`--the `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.MetricsLive` LiveView.

```elixir
# live_dashboard/telemetry_listener.ex
def handle_metrics(_event_name, measurements, metadata, {parent, metrics}) do
  time = System.system_time(:second)

  entries =
    for {metric, index} <- metrics do
      if measurement = extract_measurement(metric, measurements) do
        label = tags_to_label(metric, metadata)
        {index, label, measurement, time}
      end
    end

  send(parent, {:telemetry, entries})
end
```

The `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.MetricsLive` LiveView implements a `handle_info/2` for this `{:telemetry, entries}` event and responds by updating the `ChartComponent`, resulting in a UI update.

```elixir
# live_dashboard/live/metrics_live.ex
def handle_info({:telemetry, entries}, socket) do
  for {id, label, measurement, time} <- entries do
    data = [{label, measurement, time}]
    send_update(ChartComponent, id: id, data: data)
  end

  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

### Putting It All Together

Let's review how all of these moving parts connect.

1. We define a Telemetry supervisor, `Quantum.Telemetry`, that implements a `metrics/0` function. This function is responsible for mapping a set of Telemetry events to various types of metrics.
2. We pass our Telemetry supervisor, `Quantum.Telemetry`, as an option to our LiveDashboard in the router.
3. LiveDashboard starts up a LiveView, `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.MetricsLive`, with the metrics we defined in `Quantum.Telemetry`.
4. `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.MetricsLive` calls on `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.TelemetryListener` which stores the Telemetry events-as-metrics we defined in `Quantum.Telemetry` in ETS with its own `handle_metrics/4` handler function.
5. Later, when one of these Telemetry events is executed, Telemetry calls the stored handler function, `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.TelemetryListener.handle_metrics/4`.
6. The `handle_metrics/4` function formats the event as the specified metric and sends a message to the `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.MetricsLive` LiveView which then updates the UI!

This process if pretty cool, but there's a lot to unpack here. For a deeper dive on how Telemetry events are stored in ETS, executed and handled, check out [this post](https://elixirschool.com/blog/instrumenting-phoenix-with-telemetry-part-one/).

## LiveDashboard Request Logging

The last LiveDashboard feature that we'll set up is RequestLogger. This LiveDashboard features allows us to log all incoming requests in LiveDashboard.

### Adding RequestLogger

All we need to do to get this up and running is add the following to our app's `Endpoint` module, right before `Plug.RequestId`:

```elixir
# lib/quantum_web/endpoint.ex
plug Phoenix.LiveDashboard.RequestLogger,
  param_key: "request_logger",
  cookie_key: "request_logger"
```

Now we can visit `/dashboard` in the browser and click the `Request Logger` tab. We'll click "enable cookie" to enable a cookie that streams request logs. Now we should see the stream of our request logs:

![live dashboard request-logger]({% asset ld-request-logger.png @path %})

Let's take a brief look under the hood of LiveDashboard to get a better understanding of how RequestLogger works.

### LiveDashboard RequestLogger Under The Hood

The LiveDashboard router mounts a LiveView, `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.RequestLoggerLive`:

```elixir
# live_dashboard/router.ex
live "/:node/request_logger",
     Phoenix.LiveDashboard.RequestLoggerLive,
     :request_logger,
     opts
```

The `RequestLoggerLive` LiveView grabs the main application's PubSub server from the endpoint and subscribes to a "request logger" topic:

```elixir
# live_dashboard/live/request_logger_love.ex

def mount(%{"stream" => stream} = params, session, socket) do
  %{"request_logger" => {param_key, cookie_key}} = session

  if connected?(socket) do
    endpoint = socket.endpoint
    pubsub_server = endpoint.config(:pubsub_server) || endpoint.__pubsub_server__()
    Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(pubsub_server, Phoenix.LiveDashboard.RequestLogger.topic(stream))
  end

  socket =
    socket
    |> assign_defaults(params, session)
    |> assign(
      stream: stream,
      param_key: param_key,
      cookie_key: cookie_key,
      cookie_enabled: false,
      autoscroll_enabled: true,
      messages_present: false
    )

  {:ok, socket, temporary_assigns: [messages: []]}
end
```

This means that the `RequestLoggerLive` LiveView process is subscribed to any events that are broadcast over the "request logger" topic. It implements a `handle_info/2` function for `{:logger, level, message}` events, and responds by updating the socket and therefore the UI:

```elixir
# live_dashboard/live/request_logger_live.ex
def handle_info({:logger, level, message}, socket) do
  {:noreply, assign(socket, messages: [{message, level}], messages_present: true)}
end
```

When do `{:logger, level, message}` events get broadcast over PubSub to this topic?

LiveDashboard adds a _new_ logging backend to the application when it starts up.

```elixir
# live_dashboard/application.ex
defmodule Phoenix.LiveDashboard.Application do
  @moduledoc false
  use Application

  def start(_, _) do
    Logger.add_backend(Phoenix.LiveDashboard.LoggerPubSubBackend) # HERE!

    children = [
      {DynamicSupervisor, name: Phoenix.LiveDashboard.DynamicSupervisor, strategy: :one_for_one}
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

The `Phoenix.LiveDashboard.LoggerPubSubBackend` broadcasts the log message to the RequestLogger PubSub topic whenever it receives a log event:

```elixir
# live_dashboard/logger_pubsub_backend.ex
def handle_event({level, gl, {Logger, msg, ts, metadata}}, {format, keys} = state)
    when node(gl) == node() do
  with {pubsub, topic} <- metadata[:logger_pubsub_backend] do
    metadata = take_metadata(metadata, keys)
    formatted = Logger.Formatter.format(format, level, msg, ts, metadata)
    Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(pubsub, topic, {:logger, level, formatted}) # HERE!
  end

  {:ok, state}
end
```

And that's it!

## Conclusion

LiveDashboard adds a powerful tool to the Phoenix developer's toolkit. Now we can easily visualize the instrumentation of our application and monitor its performance and behavior in real-time as we develop. LiveDashboard represents one more entry into the growing pantheon of "developer happiness" tools that is increasingly making Phoenix, and Elixir, such a compelling option for web development.

I hope this feature tour got you excited about LiveDashboard, while our peek under the hood illustrates once again how Elixir language features like ETS and message-passing make it possible to build powerful systems that are still simple and elegant.
